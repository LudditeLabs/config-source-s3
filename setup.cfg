# Carnegie Mellon's Software Engineering Institute defines the following

#
# Cyclomatic Complexity     Risk Evaluation
# 1-10                      a simple program, without much risk
# 11-20                     more complex, moderate risk
# 21-50                     complex, high risk program
# greater than 50           untestable program (very high risk)
